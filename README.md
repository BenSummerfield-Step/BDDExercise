# BDDExercise

The purpose of this exercise is to help assess familiarity with writing good quality feature files.

This repo contains two feature files: advanced_search.feature and search.feature. Both contain a range of different issues and quirks.

Please point out and discuss:

* Any issues you find
* Any changes you would make

You don't need to have an immediate solution - the key here is to have a discussion about their quality, and to justify the changes you may want to make.
